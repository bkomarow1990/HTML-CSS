                <p>
                    William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[a] was an English playwright, poet, and
                    actor,
                    widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest
                    dramatist.[2][3][4] He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply
                    "the
                    Bard").[5][b] His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets,
                    three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have
                    been
                    translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other
                    playwright.[7] They also continue to be studied and reinterpreted.

                    Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married
                    Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime
                    between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of
                    a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49
                    (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records
                    of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such
                    matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works
                    attributed to him were written by others.[8][9][10]
                </p>
                <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[11][12][d] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.[2][3][4] In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.</p>
                <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays.[13] Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".[13]</p>

            <b>Computer programming</b> is the process of designing and building an <a href="#">executable</a> computer
            program to accomplish a
            <a href="#">specific computing</a> result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as:
            analysis,
            generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of
            algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a
            program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code,
            which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence
            of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating
            system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires
            expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized
            algorithms, and formal logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
            implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
            programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development
            is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual
            writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
            Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and
            re-create/re-implement.[3]

                programming languages</i></p>
        <p>Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer
            was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the
            Book of Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine
            where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and
            cams.[6][7] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a
            series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.</p>
        <p>Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi
            described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering
            Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest
            code-breaking algorithm.[8]</p>
        <p>The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm
            to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical
            Engine.[9]</p>
        <p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[10] Later a
            control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different
            jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by
            control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the
            stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same
            way in computer memory.[11]</p>
        <h2 id="machine_language_content">Machine language</h2>
        <p>
            Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine,
            often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction
            in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for
            specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a
            machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.
        </p>
        <h2 id="compiler_language_content">Compiler languages</h2>
        <p>High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[12] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[13][14] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.</p>
        <p>These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target for varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[15] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.</p>

        <p>
                Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.
